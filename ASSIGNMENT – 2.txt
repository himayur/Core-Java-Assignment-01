JAVA PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT – 2


•	PART A – THEORY QUESTIONS


1. What are classes and objects in Java?

	Class in java is like a Blue print which can describe the all program 
	additionaly the Class is the user difine data type with mins its used by according to the use requrments
	Calsss key word used to declare the class type. 
	Class has no requirement of memory 
	Class is create only once in a program 


	Object is the real entity . which is create with the help of  class blue print
	We can create the multipal object with the help of same class. 
	When every the object is created at that time memory is allocated.
	Object can create multiple time in program 




2. What is the difference between primitive and reference data types?
	Primitive date type is  a actule value 
	The example of primitive date type is a Int, char, long , dubble, float ,bite,short.
	primitive date pass by value.


	Reference data its give a Address of the data not give a actule value.
	When we update any value in the  main the its also update just because of adreess 
	The example of reference date type is Array, string , Class. And eytc.


3.What are access modifiers in Java?
	The access modifiers in java thay can control the variable , class, and importantly method
	The access modifiers are control the  cod and help to fare used of code 
	Thare are four type of access modifiers in java private ,protector, default, public 
	This four access modifiers give a different diferrent type of control and protection .
4 Explain the concept of encapsulation?
	Encapsulation is the function in that the we can hide the date with the help of different access modifier 
	We can access the data with the help of gatters and seters 
	Data can making private with the used of private 



5 What is inheritance and why is it used?
	In java language inheritance is the most important concept with the help of inheritance  we can used the method and properts in one class to second class. 
	The class who’s property is reflact in different class so its called the super calss or a parant class.
	And the properts thors reflatc in which class its called a child class or subclass.



•	PART B – PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS



1 Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class classWork{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); 
			System.out.println("=====ENTER THE NUMBER=====");
			int a = sc.nextInt(); 
			
			if (a>0) 
			System.out.println("=====THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE=====");
			
			else if (a==0) 
			System.out.println("=====THE NUMBER IS NUTURAL zero/=====");
		
			else 
				System.out.println("=====THE NUMBER IS NIGITIVE =====");	
}
}



2. Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.

package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class timepass{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); 
			System.out.println("=====ENTER THE NUMBER=====");
			int a = sc.nextInt();
			int b=sc.nextInt(); 
			
			a=a*b; 
			b=a/b; 
			a=a/b;
			
			System.out.println((a) +"  "+(b));
			
			}
 }
3 Write a program to find the factorial of a number using loop.
package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class classWork{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); 
			System.out.println("ENTHER THE VALUE ");
			int a = sc.nextInt(); 

		        int factorial = 1;

		        for (int i = 1; i <= a; i++) {
		            factorial = factorial * i;
		        }

		        System.out.println("Factorial of " + a + " is: " + factorial);
			
	
}
}











4 Write a program to print Fibonacci series up to n terms.
package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class timepass{
			public static void main(String[] args) { 
		        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 
		 
		        System.out.print("=====ENTER THE NUMBER====="); 
		        int n = sc.nextInt(); 
		 
		        int a = 0, b = 1; 
		         
		            System.out.println("=====Fibonacci series====="); 
		            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
		                System.out.print(a + " "); 
		                int next = a + b; 
		                a = b; 
		                b = next; 
		            } 
		        } 
		}










5 Write a program to reverse a number.

package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class classwork{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
			System.out.println("=====ENTHER THE NUMBNER=====");
			 int num =sc.nextInt(); 
		        int reverse = 0;

		     while (num != 0) {
		            int digit = num % 10;
		            reverse = reverse * 10 + digit;
		            num = num / 10;
		        }

		        System.out.println("Reversed number is: " + reverse);
	
}
}


6 Write a program to check if a number is palindrome.
package demo;
import java.util.*; 
public class timepass{
	public static void main(String[] args){ 
		 Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in); 
		   
		  int temp,n,rev=0; 
		  System.out.println("=====ENTER THE NUMBER====="); 
		 n= sc.nextInt(); 
		  
		   temp=n; 
		 while(n>0){ 
		 
		  int rem =n%10; 
		 rev = rev*10+rem; 
		 n=n/10; 
		 }  
		 
		   if(rev == temp) 
		 System.out.println("=====IT IS A PALINDROM====="); 
		 
		 else 
		 System.out.println("=====IT NOT A PALINDROM====="); 
		 
		            } 
		        }
